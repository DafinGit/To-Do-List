# My Daily To-Do List

A simple, interactive To-Do List web application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Tasks are saved locally in your browser's `localStorage` so they persist even after you close the tab.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Add New Tasks:** Easily add new To-Do items.
*   **Mark as Complete:** Toggle tasks as complete or incomplete.
*   **Delete Tasks:** Remove unwanted tasks from the list.
*   **Local Storage Persistence:** Your tasks are saved in your browser, so they're still there when you come back!
*   **Responsive Design:** Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the web page.
*   **CSS3:** For styling and layout.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all the interactive logic and `localStorage` management.

## üíª How to Run It Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    ```
    (Replace `<your-repo-url>` with the URL you get after creating your GitHub repo)
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd my-todo-list
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (e.g., by double-clicking it).
